Description
-----------

HoneyGUI is a graphics display framework independently developed by Realtek. It is an open-source embedded graphical user interface (GUI) library specifically designed for resource-constrained microcontrollers and embedded systems. HoneyGUI is lightweight, feature-rich, and highly customizable, making it widely used in consumer electronics, home appliances, medical devices, and smartwatches.

As a comprehensive display framework, HoneyGUI not only includes Realtek's self-developed display engine but also supports direct calls to external APIs such as LVGL and ARM2D for application development. Additionally, HoneyGUI provides a PC-based simulation environment, allowing developers to quickly develop and debug applications without relying on embedded hardware platforms. Furthermore, HoneyGUI can be used in conjunction with Realtek's proprietary front-end design tool, :term:`RVD`, to achieve visual programming.

Here are several common methods for APP development:

- Develop applications using the RealGUI display engine by calling C/C++ APIs.
- Directly call `LVGL <https://lvgl.io/>`_ APIs to develop applications.
- Directly call `ARM-2D <https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D>`_ APIs to develop applications.
- Front-end development using JavaScript and XML. It is recommended to use ``RVisualDesigner`` as a :term:`PC` -based design tool for low-code development.

The :term:`GUI` framework has good portability, which can run on a variety of chips and :term:`OS`. PC Windows version is provided.

Installation For Windows
-------------------------


Install Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the MinGW-w64 toolchain, unzip it to drive C, and add it to the system environment variable ``Path``.

1.  `MinGW-w64 Download <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/sjlj/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0.7z>`_
2.  Unzip and copy to directory: ``C:\mingw64``
3.  Add a environment variable: ``C:\mingw64\bin``:

   - Open the Start Menu and search for ``Advanced system setting``.
   - Show ``System Properties`` and then go to the ``Advanced`` tab.
   - Click on the ``Environment Variables`` button.
   - In the ``User variables`` section, find and select the Path variable and click ``Edit``.
   - Click ``New`` and add ``C:\mingw64\bin``.
   - Click ``OK`` to close all dialogs.


Install Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3.9.7 is tested.

Install Scons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a CMD window and execute the following commands to install the Python scons library.

.. code-block:: shell

   > pip install scons==4.4.0

After installing the ``MinGW-w64`` toolchain and ``scons`` library, you can launch the application in two ways: stratup by CMD or startup by GUI.

Startup by CMD (Scons)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open a CMD window in the ``HoneyGUI`` or ``gui`` folder, and then run the following command to start the application.

.. code-block:: shell

   > cd win32_sim
   > scons
   > cd ..
   > .\win32_sim\gui.exe

The ``scons`` command to perform the build process and then execute ``gui.exe`` to run it.

Startup by CMD (CMake)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Dependency Software
    
     **CMake** (tested with version 3.31.2): `https://cmake.org/download/ <https://cmake.org/download/>`_
    
     **MinGW-w64**: mentioned before

- Initialization: In the ``HoneyGUI`` folder

.. code-block:: shell

   > cd win32_sim
   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..

- Compilation: In the ``HoneyGUI/win32_sim/build`` folder

.. code-block:: shell
      
   > cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
   > mingw32-make -j 32

- Configuration: In the ``HoneyGUI/win32_sim/build`` folder

.. code-block:: shell

   > cmake --build . --target menuconfig

- Run: In the ``HoneyGUI`` folder

.. code-block:: shell

   > .\win32_sim\gui.exe



Startup by VSCode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
