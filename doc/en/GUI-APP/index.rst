   HoneyGUI Framework

+ In each project, multiple applications can exist simultaneously, but only one application can be in a running state at any given time, while the other applications will be in a suspended state.
+ When using different rendering engines, the upper-layer implementation of the application will vary.
+ Each :term:`APP` can create its own dedicated thread, or it may choose not to.
+ The APP can be installed, opened, closed, uninstalled, and switched.
+ The GUI_SERVER performs operations such as traversing widgets according to refresh instructions, rendering the frame buffer, executing trigger callbacks, and scheduling apps.
