Use RVD Tool Design An Application
====================================

.. note::
   **Recommended**: We recommend using the :doc:`VSCode Plugin <../VSCode/index>` for application development.
   The VSCode plugin provides a modern development experience with full offline support, code protection zones, and collaborative editing.

   This chapter describes RVisualDesigner, a legacy desktop tool suitable for maintaining existing projects.

Please refer to: `Use RVD Tool Design An Application <https://docs.realmcu.com/gui/en/v1.0.12.0.rvd/GUI-APP/SaaA/index.html>`_.
