Vivante VGLite API Driver Release Notes

This file includes a list of high level updates for each driver release.

OVERVIEW
========

Vivante VGLite Graphics API is designed to support2D vector and 2D raster-based operations for rendering
interactive user interface that may include menus, fonts, curves, and images. The VGLite API allows users
to develop customized applications for mobile or IOT devices that include Vivante Vector Graphics IP.

Please refer to

    Vivante.Programming.VGLite.Vector.Graphics.API-<version>-<date>.pdf

document for the VGLite API functions.

LIMITATION
==========

    1. Currently VGLite API driver only supports 32-bit OS/RTOS, as VGLite HW/SW is designed for embedded devices.
    2. VGLite driver only support single thread, single context rendering, it does not support multi-thread rendering.
    3. VGLite GPU does not include MMU, so VGLite driver programs GPU hardware with system memory physical addresses directly.
